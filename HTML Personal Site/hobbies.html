    <body>
      In my spare time I typically love to wind down and relax by playing video games with myfriends. Eventually my goal is to be eable to stream on twitch. Games that I currently grind are: APEX Legends, Hearthstone, and Final Fantasy.

    <body>
      I usually hit the weights and workout as a stress relief at the end of my day. One of the biggest reasons I started to lift waeights in the first place was because my family always made fun of me for being skinny. Ever since the day I started
      college I made it a mission for the last four years to build up my body.

    <body>
      I haven't started this hobby yet, but I truly enjoy cooking. Cooking is a very relaxing thing to do and can be fun once you have mastered a recipe or created one of your own.
